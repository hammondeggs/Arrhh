# As always, especially with the KORG user oscillators and effects, these are to be used at your own risk!


This is a delay effect, as using the chorus with the formant filter lends itself well.

#
### installation

Ensure you have the KORG minilogue/prologue sound librarian installed. Now, before you do anything else, **perform a full and complete backup of your synthesizer and save this to disk before continuing**. See the sound librarian manual for instructions on how to do this if required.

Next, select the USER DELAY FX tab on the librarian, and drag and drop the requisite file to an available user delay slot in the librarian :
 - for Minilogue xd users, please use arrhh.mnlgxdunit
 - for Prologue users, please use arrhh.prlgunit

You should now see arrhh! V1.00-0 listed in your user delay effects. Press "Send All" under USER OSC / FX to send all of your user oscillator / effects to your synthesizer.

*please note if you do not do this correctly you may run the risk of losing data. As always, backup, backup, backup!*

#
### usage

Two parameters are available:

Time : Adjusts the formant from an "Ahh" sound the left to more of a EEE sound to the right. *fun can be had by motion sequencing this knob, your experience may vary*

Depth: Adjust the overall resonance and depth of the effect. Note, when set to full depth, be careful as the filters may resonate quite loudly!
